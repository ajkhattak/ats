ATS: The Advanced Terrestrial Simulator
=======================================

The Advanced Terrestrial Simulator (formerly sometimes known as the Arctic Terrestrial Simulator) is a code for solving ecosystem-based, integrated, distributed hydrology.

Capabilities are largely based on solving various forms of Richards equation coupled to a surface flow equation, along with the needed sources and sinks for ecosystem and climate models.  This can (but need not) include thermal processes (especially ice for frozen soils), evapo-transpiration, albedo-driven surface energy balances, snow, biogeochemistry, plant dynamics, deformation, transport, and much more.

------------------

ATS is more than just a code, but a community of users with a lot of experience in both integrated hydrology, Arctic hydrology, and ATS code development.  Please join us on our [google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ats-users).  We try very hard to create a welcoming community that supports and enables our users to do their science.


Installation
------------

ATS is now built as a part of Amanzi directly. Please see the [ATS installation instructions](https://github.com/amanzi/amanzi/blob/master/INSTALL_ATS.md) on Amanzi's site.

Documentation
-------------

[Documentation](https://amanzi.github.io/ats/) is a work in progress, but includes a large suite of example problems.
